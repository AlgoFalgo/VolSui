📊 VolumaSui — Telegram-Native Smart Volume™ Engine for the Sui Blockchain
VolumaSui is a modular, on-chain trading orchestration framework that enables synthetic volume ignition on Sui through a Telegram-native interface. It is engineered to simulate authentic trade activity using real DEX execution and relay-based fee routing. Ideal for token projects, ecosystem grants, or meme launches looking to catalyze visibility through economically rational, auditable trading behavior.

🧠 Concept Overview
VolumaSui provides:

Permissionless volume execution via /push_volume or wallet deposit
On-chain routing through DeepBook or Cetus
Risk management with drawdown limits and volume caps
Configurable relay fee (% of trade)
Strategy execution API for programmatic trading
Transparent TX logging and analytics
It introduces a programmable attention engine, not a price oracle. Every volume push is a real, signed Sui transaction that changes token and LP state on-chain.

📊 Trade Execution Model
Let:

A = Total input amount in SUI or token
f = Relay fee rate (default 0.003 = 0.3%)
T = Tradeable amount → T = A * (1 - f)
F = Fee amount → F = A * f
VolumaSui transforms input into two linked transfers:

Copy code
1. Transfer(F) → relay wallet (e.g., deployer or protocol)
2. Swap(T)     → through DeepBook or Cetus pool
These are packaged in a single Sui transaction block, ensuring no off-chain custody and no spoofed volume.

🔧 Features
Feature	Description
Risk Management	Monitors drawdown (<10%), 24h volume (<1000), failed TXs (<3)
Strategy Engine	Configurable trading strategies via API
/push_volume	Executes on-chain volume with relay fee
/fork_bot	Deploys a branded instance with custom config
WalletMonitor	Auto-executes trades on SUI/token deposit
Analytics API	Track strategy performance and execution
📊 Why Smart Volume™ Matters
Attention drives adoption: most price movement is liquidity-chasing behavior.
Volume drives visibility: DEX charts, aggregators, and alerts surface high-volume tokens.
VolumaSui triggers visibility algorithmically through real trades initiated by chat or wallet activity.
This is not spoofing. This is on-chain attention engineering.
